# JSONBro

JSONBro is a simple Visual Studio Code extension template for working with JSON files.

## Development

Install dependencies and compile the extension:

```bash
npm install
npm run compile
```

Launch the extension in a development window by pressing `F5` in VS Code.

## Packaging

To create an installable `.vsix` package run:

```bash
npm run package
```

This will create a `jsonbro-x.y.z.vsix` file that can be installed from VS Code via the Extensions: Install from VSIX command.
